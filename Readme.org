* slc-in-shell
yar to automate manual questsss... for the slc result
might not work in future...

* Motivation:
	Bored of too much repetative manual task to get the slc ledger.

* How it works ?
- the script eats the `slc.csv` file formatted like this:

  Name of Student,symbolNoWithAplhabet,date-of-birth
  sample eg:

     Bishal Humagain,0275507k,2055-02-11

     Saurav BHuju,0275511o,2055-03-03

     Jiwan Sapkota,0275513q,2056-07-25


- Enjoy the Makefile
 `make`

- the output generated at result directory...on fly
	& need future revisions

* Behind the scene.
	the scirpt use `curl` with data params "symbol"&"dob" form the `slc.csv` file in a loop and filter the result accordingly in result folder.
  So its higly depends on slc.ntc.net.np and the formatings... so it might broke in future...
  Works for me now.. :D
