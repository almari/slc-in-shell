* slc-in-shell
yar to automate manual questsss... for the slc result
might not work in future...

* Motivation:
	Bored of too much repetative manual task to get the slc ledger.

* How it works ?
1. the script eats the slv.csv file formatted like this:

   Name of Student,symbolNoWithAplhabet,date-of-birth
Eg:
   Bishal Humagain,0275507k,2055-02-11
   Jiwan Sapkota,0275513q,2056-07-25

2. `make`
